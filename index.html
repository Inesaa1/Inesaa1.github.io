						 <h1>Italy</h1>
						 <p> Italy is one of Western Europe's youngest countries
Italy's only been a country since 1861. Yet it has one of Europe's longest histories.The country was under a dictatorship for 20 years.
Italy has more World Heritage sites than any other country.</p>
                         <p> Italy’s political geography has been conditioned by this rugged landscape. 
						 With few direct roads between them, and with passage from one point to another 
						 traditionally difficult, Italy’s towns and cities have a history 
						 of self-sufficiency, independence, and mutual mistrust. Visitors today remark
						 on how unlike one town is from the next, on the marked differences in cuisine and dialect,
						 and on the many subtle divergences that make Italy seem less a single nation than a collection 
						 of culturally related points in an uncommonly pleasing setting.</p>

				     <p> "Family is an extremely important value within the 
					 Italian culture," Talia Wagner, a Los Angeles-based marriage
					 and family therapist, told Live Science. Their family 
					 solidarity is focused on extended family rather than the 
					 West's idea of "the nuclear family" of just a mom, dad and
					 kids, Wagner explained.Italians have frequent family 
					 gatherings and enjoy spending time with those in their 
					 family. "Children are reared to remain close to the family
					 upon adulthood and incorporate their future family into the 
					 larger network," said Wagner."</p>
