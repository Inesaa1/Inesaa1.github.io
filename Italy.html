						 <h1>Italy</h1>
						 <p> Italy's location on the Mediterranean linked it 
						 with the trade routes of the ancient civilizations that 
						 developed in the region. With the city of Rome's rise to
						 power, the Italian peninsula became the center of a huge 
						 empire that lasted for centuries.</p>
                         <p> In Italy, politics can often be exciting and noisy. Crowds 
						 gather in the streets to protest government policies or to show
						 support for their party.Since World War II, Italy has
						 enjoyed an economic transformation. Industry grew, and by 
						 the mid-1960s, Italy had become one of the world's leading 
						 economies. Its main exports are clothing, shoes, food, and 
						 wine.</p>

					  <h2> People and Culture </h2>
					     <p>
						 Since the rise of the Roman Empire, Italian art,
						 architecture, and culture have had an influence around
						 the world. Famed Italian painters include Leonardo da Vinci
						 and Michelangelo. Italy is also at the heart of the
						 Catholic Church, which is governed from Vatican City,
						 a city-state surrounded by Rome.The family is at the center
						 of Italian society. Young people often live at home 
						 until they are in their 30s, even if they have a job.
						 When parents retire, they often go to live with their 
						 children.
						 </p>
					  <h3> Nature </h3>
					     <p> 
						 For 22 centuries, Italians and their ancestors have cleared
						 fields, grazed livestock, and hunted wild animals.
						 Forests that once covered large areas are gone. But 
						 the country's remote places and many national parks
						 still have wilderness largely untouched by humans.The 
						 lower slopes of Italy's Alps are covered with forests. 
						 Above these woodlands are meadows that explode with 
						 specially adapted wildflowers in the spring. Throughout 
						 Italy, millions of birds stop to rest during their annual
						 migration to Africa.
